Java library for D-Optimality-Based Sensitivity Testing (also known as Neyer D-Optimal test)

More information on the test can be found on [Neyer's website](http://neyersoftware.com/Papers/D-Optimal/D-Optimal.htm) and the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neyer_d-optimal_test)

The implementation found in this library is also based on GONOGO, an R implementation, described in [ARDEC Technical Report AREIS-CR-18007](https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~jeffwu/sensitivitytesting/gonogo2.pdf)

# Install

## Gradle

Add the following to your project

build.gradle (Project)

    repositories {
        jcenter()
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
    }
}
```
build.gradle (Module):

```
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.errorgon:sensitivitytest:1.17-SNAPSHOT'
}
```

## Maven

in your pom.xml add:

The Jitpack repo
```
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>jitpack.io</id>
        <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
```

and the dependenciy
```
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.github.errorgon</groupId>
        <artifactId>SensitivityTest</artifactId>
        <version>1.17-SNAPSHOT</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

# API

Begin by creating a new Neyer object with test parameters. 

These include initial guesses for upper and lower bounds of &#956; and &#963;, precision (number of decimals), units of measurement, and an ID. 

```
Neyer neyer = new Neyer("m", 0.6, 1.4, 0.1, 3, "test");
```

Begin testing by generating the value of our next test, defined here by inner class Neyer.Run

```
Neyer.Run run = neyer.getRun();
```

The Neyer.Run object is created with public methods for obtaining the number of test the user is on and the value at which to test
```
int trial = run.getTrial();  // Number of tests (i.e. 1 for the first test of the series)
double value = run.getValue(); // Value at which to test
```

The user can now perform the test and report back the result 
```
run.setResult(true); // or false - depending on the result
```

The run is now fully defined and can be added to the list of previous runs to generate the next test value. 
```
neyer.setRun(run);
```

Alternatively, an overloaded setRun method is provided so that a new run can be redefined with an arbitrary test value (i.e. user can choose not to test at the generated test value)
```
// trial = 1   test value = 1.1   result = false
neyer.setRun(1, 1.1, false);
```

The next test can be generated by again calling
```
Neyer.Run run = neyer.getRun();
```

MLE's of &#956; and &#963; can be found after setting a run
```
...
neyer.setRun(run);
double muEstimate = run.getMu();
double sigmaEstimate = run.getSig();
```
